            <h4>The History of Adidas:</h4>
            <p>Adidas was founded by Adolf Dassler who made sports shoes in his mother's scullery or laundry room in Herzogenaurach, Germany after his return from World War I. In July 1924, his older brother Rudolf joined the business, which became Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory (Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik).</p>

            <h4>Adidas Inspirations:</h4>
            <p>Every great story has a beginning. This one started in a small town in Bavaria, Germany. After first steps in his mother’s wash kitchen, Adi Dassler registered the “Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik” in 1924 and embarked on his mission to provide athletes with the best possible equipment. Gold medals in Amsterdam (1928, Lina Radke) and Berlin (1936, Jesse Owens) were first rewards and milestones – and only the start of our story.

            <p>Adidas is sold pretty much anywhere, it is available on their actual website, JD, Sports Direct, ASOS and Urban Outfitters (etc). Adidas shoes range from $75-$176 or £55-£130. It isn't hard for an individual to get ahold of some Adidas.

            <h4>Adidas Hype:</h4>
            <p>Adidas emphasizes comfort while mixing high fashion and budget brands, and also draws in various subcultures (like skateboarding and sport). Younger audiences are always the target audience for Adidas however the brand takes heavy inspiration from retired retro designs.</p>

            <h4>The History of Nike:</h4>
            <p>The company was founded on January 25, 1964, as Blue Ribbon Sports, by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, and officially became Nike, Inc. on May 30, 1971. The company takes its name from Nike, the Greek goddess of victory.

            <h4>Nike Inspirations:</h4>
            <p>Designers at Nike take inspiration from very innovative things to develop their products. Designers Laura Parrett and Jeff Rasmussen took inspiration from the Chinese finger trap device while designing the Nike Free Trainer 5.0. Like the toy, the upper consists of intertwined bands that are soft and pliable. When the foot is at rest or moving forward or backward, the bands are flexible and compliant. When pressure is applied with side-to-side movements the bands engage and tighten around the foot for enhanced support. As designer Leo Chang began the process of designing the KD VI 18 months ago, he found inspiration in the precision craftsmanship of a wristwatch.

            <h4>Nike Hype:</h4>
            <p>Nike has become a company that has benefitted greatly from the shoe culture. If Nike shoes were never made, I’m not too sure if the company would even be around today. The impact that they have made our culture is huge. The fact that people have killed others, which is a ridiculously sad thought, to own a pair of Nike shoes is crazy. Since Nike is a very prominent worldwide company, will their shoe industry ever die off? The fact that people express the need to own every color in style shoe that Nike has produced suggests that the company may never die off.
